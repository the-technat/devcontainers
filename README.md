# devcontainers

I'm currently exporing what devcontainers can do. This repo contains a bunch of different `devcontainer.json` files, maybe some prebuilds and some dotfiles that I want in devcontainers. These dotfiles differ from the dotfiles I'd install on my machine.

## dotfiles

The dotfiles in this repo are based on [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io) and intended to be installed on Ubuntu-based distros.
